# HOSPITAL-NETWORK-DESIGN
Hospitals currently use a manual system for the management and maintenance of critical information. The current system requires numerous paper forms, with data stores spread throughout the hospital management infrastructure. Often information (on forms) is incomplete, or does not follow management standards. Forms may also be lost in transit between departments requiring a comprehensive auditing process to ensure that no vital information is lost. Multiple copies of the same information exist in the hospital and may lead to inconsistencies in data in various data stores.
